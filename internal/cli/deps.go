// path in authwiring.go. Production code never constructs a non-zero
// cliDeps; it exists so tests can run a command end-to-end through
// root.Execute() against a mock gateway instead of a real dial.
//
// A single call reads this struct in exactly one place: resolveAuth, which
// treats either field being non-nil as "this call is test-injected" and
// returns both the (possibly defaulted) TokenSource and Target; its result
// then flows into dialOrInjected, which substitutes Gateway when present.
// Nothing else inspects cliDeps directly, so there is one decision point, not
// several that could disagree about whether a given field was injected.
